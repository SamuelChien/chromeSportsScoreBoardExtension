**Goal of our team**

**Competencies:**

-   Everyone is knowledgeable about the language we plan to use for the
    addon
-   Everyone is proactive in wanting to contribute and drive forward the
    progress of our addon.
-   Everyone is comfortable with our current collaboration methods
-   Everyone has a varied skill set and this allows us to easily divide
    the work that needs to be done.

**Constraints:**

-   Most members’ schedule does not mesh well with others. Besides
    meeting for a few minutes after class, due to the conflicts, most
    work will not be done together in person. This in general might slow
    down the process of quickly sharing information, but we plan to try
    to alleviate this using a live group chat.
-   Most members haven’t worked with APIs before. A lot of us will have
    to learn new technologies from scratch for this project, which will
    slow down things for sure.
-   In addition to lots of schedule conflicts, a lot of us live very far
    from university so meeting in person is unlikely to happen unless
    the meeting is for something very important.

    class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>
-   Both meetings were in person, however we did follow up regarding
    ideas online in a facebook group chat. Additionally we pitched
    support for our ideas in a google document which was available to
    all the members.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>

**Future Meetings, decisions, and roles**

-   After each lecture we plan to meet for a few minutes to discuss the
    progress of our addon and specifically the progress of our
    individual tasks. During these meetings we will also discuss if
    anyone needs help specific parts.<span
    class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>
-   We will also make key decisions in person because it is easier for
    everyone to pitch in their views regarding some topic in person
    versus in an online chat. Our decisions will primarily be based on
    what the majority of the team feels, however we will take into
    account all views when trying to make choices that drive
    the project.
-   We also have a facebook group chat that is open for anyone to
    contribute or say anything at any time.
-   In regards to roles we have not designated anyone into any specific
    role for meetings. We expect to give any member that has anything to
    say a chance to voice their opinion and ideas.<span
    class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>



**How will be collaborate?**

We plan to use github to share the code we create amongst the other
members of the group. We will maintain a main repository where we each
can do a pull request to that repository to include our contributions in
the final code.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>

We also plan to use our facebook group chat to speed up the process.

-   For example, letting group members know as soon as possible when we
    are doing pull requests and need approval or review, etc.
